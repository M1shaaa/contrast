title: "I stand against systematic barriers to equitable science"
---

As a scholar committed to promoting equity and inclusion in the academic realm, I am acutely aware of the systemic barriers that hinder equal opportunity for all. It is unfortunate that many individuals, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, face a lack of access to critical information and resources necessary for success in academia, such as science materials, grant and scholarship applications, and admission procedures.

Inspired by my mentor Rosie Aboody, I have resolved to take concrete steps towards addressing this issue by fully embracing open science practices. As someone who has faced personal challenges as a historically underrepresented individual, I recognize the numerous opportunities that have been afforded to me, both tangible and intangible.

With this in mind, I have created a repository of resources that have supported my own journey, with the hope that they may prove useful to others facing similar obstacles. By advocating for open science and actively sharing knowledge and resources, I believe we can create a more equitable academic landscape that enables all individuals to achieve their full potential.
