title: "I stand against systematic barriers to equitable science"
---

As an individual committed to promoting equity and inclusion in the academia, I am acutely aware of the systemic barriers that hinder equal opportunity for all. Those from disadvantaged backgrounds tend to face a lack of access to critical information and resources - science materials, grant and scholarship applications, and admission procedures - necessary for success in academia.

Inspired by my mentor Rosie Aboody, I have resolved to take concrete steps towards addressing this issue by fully embracing open science practices. Even as someone who has faced personal challenges as a historically underrepresented individual, I recognize the numerous opportunities that have been afforded to me, both tangible and intangible.

With this in mind, I have created a repository of resources that have supported my own journey, with the hope that they may prove useful to others facing similar obstacles. By advocating for open science and actively sharing knowledge and resources, I believe we can create a more equitable academic landscape that enables all individuals to achieve their full potential.
